<p>I run a number of network services for our household. These include <a href="http://openvpn.net/">VPN servers</a>, handlers for web services like <a href="https://www.twilio.com/">Twilio</a>, and a couple of websites. Most of these aren&rsquo;t actually very interesting, but they need to work without a lot of fuss and without a huge investment of capital. File serving happens inside the house, but I found that I needed a number of independent services running outside in order to avoid network anarchy.</p>

<p>I ran a server on <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/">Amazon EC2</a> for a couple of years and was relatively happy with it; however, the cost and complexity led me to look for other options. EC2 is designed to operate at huge scale, and it has a lot of complexity for someone interested in one or two sites. I speak the language, and have a lot of respect for the service, but it wasn&rsquo;t a great fit for me.</p>

<p>Enter <a href="https://www.heroku.com/">Heroku</a>, a stable, managed platform designed to simplify deployment of web services and dynamic sites. Heroku is a PaaS (Platform as a Service) that was designed originally for Ruby apps, but which now supports a variety of languages and frameworks. Their way of doing things is attractive for a number of reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li>Each independent site/app is isolated in its own environment, with its own resources and dependencies.</li>
<li>Deployment is set up in a structured and modular way, using <a href="http://git-scm.com/">Git</a>. Push your content to their site and it&rsquo;s live, with recursive dependency fetching.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s straightforward to add cloud-sourced backend services like databases, caching layers, analytics, etc. There&rsquo;s a whole ecosystem, and billing is centralized.</li>
<li>There&rsquo;s a very capable free tier that lets you host small projects with no investment (and the same applies for most of the standard add-on services).</li>
</ul>

<p>The free tier is great; you can spin up an arbitrary number of web apps, each of which runs in its own 512 MB sandboxed environment. The free server apps (&ldquo;dynos&rdquo;, in Heroku&rsquo;s parlance) do spin down after a few minutes of disuse, and require a bit of time to fire back up when the next request hits. Hard to argue with free.</p>

<p>The problem with Heroku&mdash;if it can be called a problem&mdash;is that it&rsquo;s overkill for most personal projects. This makes a lot of sense if you&rsquo;re running a company off of it; however, their pricing is a harder proposition if the consequence of downtime is <em>mild inconvenience</em>, rather than <em>business apocalypse</em>. It&rsquo;s, like, $34.50/mo (USD) for the initial paid tier, as of March 2014. Speaking personally, that&rsquo;s well above my web-app <a href="/info/glossary/">latte threshold</a>, though you definitely get rock-solid performance for the money.</p>

<p>On a personal note, I have limited discretionary funds before I have to start justifying such critical tasks as: backing up data three times, running carrier grade VoIP services for our house, insisting on UPS battery backups, making lighting computer controllable, running gigabit <em>everywhere</em>, etc.</p>

<h2 id="toc_0">That&rsquo;ll do, Pig;Â that&rsquo;ll do</h2>

<p>&ldquo;There must be a better way!&rdquo; you say. I think there is, and these things are developing quickly, so this may iterate a few times in the near future. Let&rsquo;s introduce things recursively:</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/progrium/dokku">Dokku</a> is a minimal open-source re-implementation of the Heroku <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/buildpacks">Buildpack</a>-based PaaS infrastructure (&ldquo;the smallest PaaS implementation you&rsquo;ve ever seen&rdquo;), which runs on
<a href="https://www.docker.io/">Docker</a>, itself a set of services designed to make <a href="https://linuxcontainers.org/">LXC Containers</a> usable. Docker is billed as &ldquo;an open source project to pack, ship and run any application as a lightweight container&rdquo;. Docker is useful because it simplifies deployment of bundles that encapsulate the dependencies and functionality of a whole application stack.</p>

<p>Dokku makes it straightforward to depoloy things in a Heroku-esque environment running on your own hardware. It&rsquo;s a project by <a href="https://twitter.com/progrium">Jeff Lindsay</a>, and you can find out a lot more on <a href="http://progrium.com/blog/2013/06/19/dokku-the-smallest-paas-implementation-youve-ever-seen/">his blog</a>. In the long run, it&rsquo;s looking like the successor, <a href="https://flynn.io/">Flynn</a>, will turn out to be even cooler and more capable (but it&rsquo;s still under development as I write this).</p>

<p>I run Dokku on <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/">Digital Ocean</a>, which works fantastically-well for about $5/mo. See tutorials <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/articles/how-to-use-the-digitalocean-dokku-application">here</a> and <a href="https://www.andrewmunsell.com/blog/dokku-tutorial-digital-ocean">here</a>. Of course, it&rsquo;s quite trivial to install on your own hardware too; just check out the instructions in the <a href="https://github.com/progrium/dokku">Dokku GitHub repository</a>. Digital Ocean is also a great lightweight replacement for parts of <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/">Amazon Web Services</a>, though certainly at a smaller scale.</p>

<p>For now, I&rsquo;m going to avoid talking about setup in much detail. To create a new Dokku site, you just add a deployment target in the Git repository for your Buildpack/Procfile-enabled app:</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">git remote add dokku dokku@somekindasite.com:blog.git
</code></pre>

<p>When you push (<code>git push dokku master</code>), a whole bunch of cool things happen. First off, the push is handled by Git per normal. On the server end, the <code>dokku</code> user maintains a Git repository that receives the content. But, there&rsquo;s a receive hook (handled by <a href="https://github.com/progrium/gitreceive">gitreceive</a>) that checks to see if the target repository exists. If it <em>doesn&rsquo;t</em>, Dokku&rsquo;s underlying framework springs into motion and sets up the repository; it also starts putting together a Docker/LXC container to hold the app. Then, whether it was a new app or not, Dokku syncs in the new content and handles the buildpack&mdash;this means pulling any dependencies, setting up the app, and launching it as a service.</p>

<p>One really cool feature of Dokku: you can speecify the target domain in the Git remote address. In the example above, <code>blog</code> will coerce to a subdomain of whatever wildcard domain is set up for Dokku. See below for some examples (it&rsquo;s assumed that <code>somekindasite.com</code> is specified as the default domain for the Dokku installation). This works for arbitrary bare domains as well.</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Git Remote Entry</th>
<th>VirtualHost</th>
</tr>
</thead>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td><code>dokku@somekindasite.com:blog.git</code></td>
<td>blog.somekindasite.com</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><code>dokku@somekindasite.com:www.git</code></td>
<td>www.somekindasite.com</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><code>dokku@somekindasite.com:www.somekindasite.com.git</code></td>
<td>www.somekindasite.com</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><code>dokku@somekindasite.com:somekindasite.com.git</code></td>
<td>somekindasite.com</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><code>dokku@dramatichats.com.git</code></td>
<td>dramatichats.com</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>Under the hood, this is making use of Docker containers with private networking. Dokku decides what ports to expose, and the connections for each app are reverse proxied using <a href="http://wiki.nginx.org/">Nginx</a> Server Blocks (cf. VirtualHost entries) that are generated automatically.</p>

<p>So, you can run your entire workflow using Git, a couple of command-line scripts, and an easily-maintained <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a> Server virtual machine. It may not work for everyone or everything, but it&rsquo;s simplified my workflows substantially and made it easier to maintain services and sites in my spare time.</p>
